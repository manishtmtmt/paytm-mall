Before I start telling anything about project I want to thank Masai School for providing us such a great opportunity to build a clone of website. This shows the quality of education that Masai is providing to their students and the students are able to build a clone of any website within a time limit of 7 days.

This seems easy but its very challenging to build a functional website as we are new to it. But at the same time it enhances our coding skills as well as our soft skills.

Our aim was to clone the website and its components with functionality. It was quiet challenging for me and my team members. We discussed for some time and decided to work on different parts of it. This was a tough opportunity because we were a team of 4 members and our project was big considering the size of our team. Although we have tried our level best to build the website clone that looks and works exactly same as original. I am sharing some pictures of our project. Please have a look on them.
